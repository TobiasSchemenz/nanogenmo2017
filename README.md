# nanogenmo2017

This program is supposed to write a novel of given length (generally nanowrimo standard of 50,000 words).

Each commit should meet that criteria.

## General Idea

I take my inspiration from Dan Harmon's Story Cirlce, the Hero's Journey, Dramatica, the Seven-Plot-Point system, the Story Grid system, and the Scene-Sequel Format, in no particular order.

## First Version

I set up the general structure. Two halves, four sections each. In the first half, we go from location A to B to C ... to Y to Z, while in the second half, we go from Z to Y ... to C to B to A.

A tool we used in section x of half 1, we will use in section x of half 2.

Each section should use some result of the section immediately before it, and possibly some results of other previous sections.
